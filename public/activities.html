<h1>Activities</h1>

<p>
    I am currently taking an online course on Machine Learning with Python as this is field, 
    I would like to work in, in the future. I love to run, and I recently completed my second 
    half marathon and plan on taking part in more in the future. In the summer of 2019, 
    I travelled to Lourdes, France with a pilgrimage trust for a week. I am hoping to go 
    again this Summer with the same group. As a helper, I supported people with disabilities
     in various activities and assisted with pushing wheelchairs throughout the week.
